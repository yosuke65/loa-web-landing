    question: "What is LoA and how does it work?",
    answer: "LoA (Law of Attraction) is an app that brings ancient manifestation principles into your digital life. When you try to open distracting apps, LoA pauses the action and shows you a personalized affirmation screen. This creates a moment of conscious awareness where you can align with your intentions before proceeding, transforming mindless scrolling into mindful manifestation practice."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Law of Attraction apply to phone usage?",
    answer: "The Law of Attraction teaches that our thoughts and energy shape our reality. Most phone usage is unconscious and scatters our energy toward things we don't actually want more of (anxiety, comparison, distraction). LoA helps you redirect that energy consciously toward what you DO want to attract - abundance, peace, focus, and intentional living."
  },
  {
    question: "What apps can LoA monitor and intercept?",
    answer: "You can choose which apps to monitor based on your personal goals. Most users select social media apps (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook), entertainment apps (YouTube, Netflix), and games that tend to create mindless scrolling. LoA gives you full control over which apps get the affirmation treatment."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize my affirmations?",
    answer: "Absolutely! This is where LoA becomes truly powerful. You can create personalized affirmations that align with your specific manifestation goals - whether that's attracting love, abundance, career success, or inner peace. The app shows these affirmations at the perfect moment when you're about to engage with potentially distracting content."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data and personal affirmations private?",
    answer: "Yes, completely. Your manifestation journey is deeply personal, so LoA keeps all data on your device. Your affirmations, app usage patterns, and insights never leave your phone. This isn't just about privacy - it's about maintaining the sacred nature of your personal growth work."
  },
  {
    question: "Will LoA completely block my apps?",
    answer: "No, LoA doesn't block apps - it creates conscious choice. After viewing your affirmation, you can choose to continue with the app or redirect your energy elsewhere. The goal isn't restriction but awareness. Many users find that after seeing their affirmation, they naturally choose more aligned activities."
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly will I see results with manifestation?",
    answer: "The Law of Attraction works through consistency and belief. Some users notice shifts in their energy and awareness immediately, while manifestation of specific desires varies. The key is that each affirmation moment builds your manifestation 'muscle' and keeps you aligned with your intentions throughout the day."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to believe in the Law of Attraction for this to work?",
    answer: "While belief amplifies results, even skeptics benefit from LoA's core function: creating pauses for conscious decision-making. At minimum, you'll develop more intentional phone habits. At maximum, you'll transform your relationship with technology into a daily manifestation practice."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use LoA for goals beyond reducing screen time?",
    answer: "Absolutely! LoA is designed for manifestation, not just screen time management. Users create affirmations for attracting relationships, career opportunities, health, abundance, and personal growth. Every time you see your affirmation, you're programming your subconscious and aligning your energy with your desires."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a premium version with additional features?",
    answer: "Yes, LoA Premium includes advanced manifestation tools like guided visualization sessions, manifestation tracking, multiple affirmation sets for different life areas, detailed energy insights, and exclusive content on Law of Attraction principles and practices."
